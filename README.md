# Dataset Investigation Project

## Description
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The goal is to clean, visualize, and analyze the data to uncover patterns, insights, and trends. The project is suitable for learning data analysis techniques and understanding how to approach data-driven storytelling.

## Introduction
The project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how to work with datasets, from data cleaning to creating insightful visualizations. This project is intended for students and professionals wanting to explore data analysis using Python.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains multiple variables across different categories. The data source may include public datasets like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any provided sample dataset. The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for analysis.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment.
- **Python**: Programming language used.
- **Libraries**:
  - **Pandas**: For data cleaning and manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.

## Features of the Analysis
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, etc.
- Data Visualization: Creating plots to visualize trends and patterns.
- Statistical Analysis: Basic statistics to understand dataset properties.
- Insight Extraction: Summarizing findings and insights from the dataset.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/funloader/Investigate_Dataset_Notebook.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Investigate_Dataset_Notebook
3. Install the required libraries (preferably in a virtual environment):
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Investigate_Dataset.ipynb

## Results and Insights
This project explores the dataset to identify trends, correlations, and potential outliers. The main findings include statistical summaries, visualized patterns using charts, and insights into the relationships between different variables. Key insights are documented in the notebook to facilitate further discussion and exploration.
